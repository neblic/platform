# Get Data Samples from Go services

To get `Data Samples` from your Go services, you can use the `sampler` [module](https://pkg.go.dev) which is provided as part of the Neblic platform code. Since Go is the primary language used by Neblic to implement its components, this library acts as the reference implementation of the Neblic `Control Plane` protocol, so it will always implement the latest features.
