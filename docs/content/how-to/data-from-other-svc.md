# Get Data Samples from other services

If there is no Neblic SDK, it is always possible to send *Data Samples* directly to the *Collector* by encoding them as OpenTelemetry logs and setting the appropriate tags.

You can find more details in [this](/learn/samplers/#using-opentelemetry-sdk) page and an example of how to configure Java services to send properly encoded OpenTelemetry logs in [here](/how-to/data-from-java-svc/)
